# SlimeKnightRepo

I want to highlight the **procedural noodle arm system** I independently designed and engineered: https://github.com/FarCaptain/SlimeKnightRepo/blob/main/PlayerCharacter/ArmSplineComponent.cpp
Also the "auto-aim" Grabbing mechanic I added onto the character : https://github.com/FarCaptain/SlimeKnightRepo/blob/main/PlayerCharacter/RCTCharacter.cpp
Made most of the combat mechanics: grab, throw, slap. Worked on Player character, Enemies and grabbables.
